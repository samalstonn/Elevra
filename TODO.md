## TODO

- [ ] Add response streaming for the assistant chat so candidates see replies live.
- [ ] Automatically scroll the chat window to the most recent message.
- [ ] Refresh the chat UI with user/assistant avatars and improved layout.
- [ ] Render assistant markdown responses properly and display full URLs instead of slug-based citation labels.
- [ ] Connect the assistant to the paid feature gating logic.
- [ ] Broaden the overall UI polish pass beyond the chat surface.
- [ ] Investigate and fix the “Unable to load assistant” bug (likely tied to the first-load `useEffect` guard).
