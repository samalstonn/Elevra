To make matters worse, the last Student Activity fee hike included an 83% pay raise for the Student Assembly. I’ll work to cut the Student Activity fee and hold the Student Assembly accountable so you can keep more of your money. I will seek common-sense solutions to address the issues that matter to you.    Now, I am asking for your support because as your representative, I will get to work every day to build a better Cornell for you.","clerkUserId":null,"history":[],"id":228,"status":"PENDING","verified":false,"photoUrl":null,"hidden":false,"slug":"eric-yao-2","donationCount":0,"email":"egy4@cornell.edu","phone":null,"votinglink":null},{"name":"Jinzhou Wu","party":"Government and Computer Science","policies":null,"website":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-15 01:13:54.688","updatedAt":"2025-04-15 01:13:54.688","additionalNotes":"Freshman, Class of 2028","city":null,"linkedin":null,"photo":"/jinzhou-wu.jpg","position":"Running For International Students Representative","sources":["https://assembly.cornell.edu/international-students-representative"],"state":null,"bio":"Hi! My name is Jinzhou Wu, and I am an international student from Beijing, China. I currently serve as the Freshman Representative, focusing on transparency, community, and student well-being.   As a member of the Communications Committee, I lead efforts to clearly communicate weekly meeting agendas and decisions on Instagram and expand SA’s outreach through a more engaging social media strategy. On the Student Health Advocacy Committee, I sponsored Resolution 26: Vending Self-Care Supplies and am working to improve mental health resources by adding bean bags and sleeping pods to libraries. I also helped pass Resolution 37: Protecting Immigrant Students, addressing the challenges international students face due to administrative policies.   My term as Freshman Representative has provided me with the training and experience needed to take on greater initiatives next term. As an international student, I understand firsthand the challenges we face, from administrative hurdles to community integration. With ongoing executive orders affecting international students, I will advocate for our rights, safety, and welfare while continuing efforts in transparency, community, and improving student life.   I’d be honored to have your support!","clerkUserId":null,"history":null,"id":229,"status":"PENDING","verified":false,"photoUrl":null,"hidden":false,"slug":"jinzhou-wu-2","donationCount":0,"email":"jw2782@cornell.edu","phone":null,"votinglink":null},{"name":"Alexander Walters","party":"Public Policy","policies":null,"website":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-15 01:13:55.182","updatedAt":"2025-04-15 01:13:55.182","additionalNotes":"Freshman, Class of 2028","city":null,"linkedin":null,"photo":"/alexander-walters.jpg","position":"Running For LGBTQIA+ Students Representative","sources":["https://assembly.cornell.edu/lgbtqia+-students-representative"],"state":null,"bio":"What do students want most from their representative? Probably the same thing I’d want- relatability. How ‘representative’ is a candidate if you don’t share experiences with them? If you can’t have a real conversation with them? I’d argue not very. I’m running because I want to change that. I won’t just vote for whatever proposition seems best; I want to know what you really think, and how you would vote if given the chance. Whether it’s over coffee, or just walking around campus, I’d always be ready to hear what you have to say.

My campaign is simple: less talk, more action. As your Representative-At-Large, I've focused on making real, practical changes based on your needs. You wanted meal swipes at Trillium—so as chair of the dining committee, I co-sponsored a resolution, and now dining is actively working on it. When I heard Halal meat was tough to get, I ensured that dining would expand its sources. When I saw student workers struggling, I joined with the Student Workers' Representative to make sure the assembly addressed it.   I'm here to tackle the everyday challenges we all face and to make sure resources like the Student Assembly Infrastructure Fund and special projects funding are easy for you to use. The Student Assembly shouldn't just work for you—it should work with you. As EVP, I'll always be ready to support your ideas and initiatives.   Let’s cut the nonsense and boost real student engagement together! Vote for action. Vote for accessibility. Vote for results.","clerkUserId":null,"history":null,"id":245,"status":"PENDING","verified":false,"photoUrl":null,"hidden":false,"slug":"ezra-galperin-2","donationCount":0,"email":"egg48@cornell.edu","phone":null,"votinglink":null},{"name":"Test Candidate","party":"Independent","policies":["bond election"],"website":null,"createdAt":"2025-04-22 19:45:59.002","updatedAt":"2025-04-22 19:46:28.349","additionalNotes":null,"city":"Princeton","linkedin":null,"photo":null,"position":"School Board","sources":[],"state":"NJ","bio":"Test biography","clerkUserId":"user_2w69NKgchz5DGJxJRsJqz25LhaM","history":[],"id":278,"status":"APPROVED","verified":true,"photoUrl":null,"hidden":false,"slug":"test-candidate","donationCount":0,"email":null,"phone":null,"votinglink":null}]
