In one notable case, Shelton ruled against a county sheriff’s department policy of deleting interrogation recordings, demonstrating her concern for due process and transparency.

She also championed criminal justice reforms; for example, she supported the creation of a process for independent investigations into police-involved deaths and sought to give judges more discretion in handling driver’s license suspensions for drug offenses. Taylor was a vocal opponent of 2011’s Act 10, siding with public workers against the rollback of collective bargaining rights. She has long promoted fair redistricting practices and was an outspoken critic of partisan gerrymandering. Now, as a judge, Taylor emphasizes a justice system that is responsive and representative of the community it serves. She often highlights the importance of addressing underlying social factors — such as economic, health, and safety disparities — that affect justice and outcomes in Milwaukee.
