Drawing on my past and current leadership and research experiences, I prioritize execution over empty promises, focusing on steady, meaningful progress rather than abrupt shifts. By actively listening to student concerns and advocating for tangible solutions, I will work to ensure that Cornell becomes a place where every student feels supported and empowered.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Please feel free to contact me at kpn27@cornell.edu. I would love to get to know you and hear your ideas!",

My experience in healthcare and community service has prepared me to tackle critical issues on campus. Moreover, as a Meinig Family National Scholar, I have worked closely with university officials, including my current mentor, the Associate Vice President of Public Safety, to understand and improve responses to student needs, including sexual assault and mental health support.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Firstly, I aim to focus my efforts on implementing and enforcing more anti-sexual assault measures, such as bystander intervention trainings, self defense classes, increased awareness about support services for survivors, and increased transparency between the administration and undergraduate body.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, I aim to improve access to essential products by expanding menstrual product availability in public restrooms and installing vending machines for reproductive products like Plan B in areas like West Campus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let's work together to create a safer, more inclusive Cornell.",
