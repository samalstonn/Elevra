Act as a diligent and thorough researcher to gather detailed, accurate, and up-to-date election information. 

Your task is to provide comprehensive details about all candidates for the attached election details. Create a new JSON object for each 
differing municipality.

Please take your time to verify every piece of information carefully to avoid inaccuracies—especially for URLs. If a link cannot be confirmed as accurate or is not available, mark it as "N/A."

Please provide the output as a JSON array of objects. Each array item must match:
{
  "election": {
    "title": "Official title of the election (e.g., 'School Board')",
    "type": "LOCAL, UNIVERSITY, or STATE",
    "date": "MM/DD/YYYY",
    "city": "City where the election is taking place",
    "state": "State where the election is taking place (full name, not abbreviation)",
    "number_of_seats": "Number of seats available in the election. If not available or unverified, mark as 'N/A'",
    "description": "A brief overview of the election, including its significance and any unique aspects"
  },
  "candidates": [
    {
      "name": "Full legal name",
      "currentRole": "Current role (e.g., 'Incumbent Village Mayor' or 'Business Owner')",
      "party": "All political party affiliations",
      "image_url": "Confirm the URL is accurate. Mark as 'N/A'",
      "linkedin_url": "Confirm the URL is accurate. If not available or unverified, mark as 'N/A'",
      "campaign_website_url": "Confirm the URL is accurate.  Mark as 'N/A'",
      "bio": "A comprehensive background including education, experience, and career history",
      "key_policies": [
        "Up to 5 major policies the candidate supports"
      ],
      "home_city": "The candidate’s hometown city. If not available or unverified, mark as 'N/A'",
      "hometown_state": "The candidate’s hometown state. Make sure the state is NOT in abbreviated form (eg. NOT NY or PA). If not available or unverified, mark as 'N/A'",
      "additional_notes": "Any extra information (e.g., relevant controversies, endorsements, or unique campaign aspects)",
      "sources": [
        "A list of verified sources (no need for URLs just general page description) used to gather this information"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
